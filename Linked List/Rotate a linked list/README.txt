Given a singly linked list of size N. The task is to left-shift the linked list by k nodes, where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
value[] = {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
k = 3
Output: 8 9 2 4 7
Explanation:
Rotate 1: 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2
Rotate 2: 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4
Rotate 3: 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7
Example 2:

Input:
N = 8
value[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
k = 4
Output: 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4

LOGIC:
1) Use the concept of circular linekd list
2) first make the linked list circular by changifn the NULL to head node
3) after that store head pointer to some variable, and traverse the list till k-1 position is reached
4) now make this position as head node and print the list
5) Time Compelxity : O(n)
6) Space Complexity:: O(n)
