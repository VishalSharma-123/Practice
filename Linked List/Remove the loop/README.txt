Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x = 2
Output: True
Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
x = 0
Output: False
Explanation: For N = 4 ,x = 0 means
then lastNode->next = NULL, then
the Linked list does not contains
any loop.

Logic:
1) same as the previous one, by making a flag poited by the node
2) when there is a loop, the flag value will already be 1, which means already traveled. 
3) Thus loop exists
4) Time Complexity: O(n)
5) Space Complexity: O(1)
