Given a Linked List of size N, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:
(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
Each of the sub-linked-list is in sorted order.
Flatten the Link List such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order. 
Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of next pointer.

 

Example 1:

Input:
5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
|     |     |     | 
7     20    22   35
|           |     | 
8          50    40
|                 | 
30               45
Output:  5-> 7-> 8- > 10 -> 19-> 20->
22-> 28-> 30-> 35-> 40-> 45-> 50.
Explanation:
The resultant linked lists has every 
node in a single level.
(Note: | represents the bottom pointer.)
 

Example 2:

Input:
5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
|          |                
7          22   
|          |                 
8          50 
|                           
30              
Output: 5->7->8->10->19->20->22->30->50
Explanation:
The resultant linked lists has every
node in a single level.



LOGIC:
1) the concept is similar to merge sort
2) in this every list from top to down in cosidered as a linked list need to be merged
3) two recurssive func are called
4) first one is merge sort fucntion
5) second one goes to the right of the linked list and merges the list
6) Time complxity: O(n*m)
