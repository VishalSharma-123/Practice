Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6
Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: After reversing the list, 
elements are 6->5->4->3->2->1.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->7->8->9->10
Output: 10 9 8 7 2
Explanation: After reversing the list,
elements are 10->9->8->7->2.

Logic: 
1) It is the same as inserting a new node at the start of the linekd list
2) code will be same as previous one
3) time complexity: O(n)
4) space complextiy: O(n)
