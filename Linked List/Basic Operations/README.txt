Given a singly linked list of N nodes.
The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the linked list is
1-> 2->3->4->5, then the middle node of the list is 3.
If there are two middle nodes(in case, when N is even), print the second middle element.
For example, if the linked list given is 1->2->3->4->5->6, then the middle node of the list is 4.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 3 
Explanation: 
Middle of linked list is 3.
Example 2: 

Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1
Output: 7 
Explanation: 
Middle of linked list is 7.

Logic:
1) The linked list formed is reversed, because the other pointer need to be chosen for even elements
2) make two pointers
3) increment fast pointer by two and slow pointer by 1
4) when fast reaches NULL. print the slow one;
5) time complexity O(n)
