Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. Substring of string S: S[ i . . . . j ] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(S). Palindrome string: A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, S is palindrome if reverse(S) = S. Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).


Example 1:

Input:
S = "aaaabbaa"
Output: aabbaa
Explanation: The longest Palindromic
substring is "aabbaa".
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "abc"
Output: a
Explanation: "a", "b" and "c" are the 
longest palindromes with same length.
The result is the one with the least
starting index.

Logic:
1) need to find all odd and even palindromes
2) for odd, assign a center, left and right
3) for every center decrease left and increase right till they are equal
4) for even, assign left and right and follow step 3
5) Time complexity: O(N^2)
6) Space complexity: O(1)
