Given a String S, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by dots.

Example 1:

Input:
S = i.like.this.program.very.much
Output: much.very.program.this.like.i
Explanation: After reversing the whole
string(not individual words), the input
string becomes
much.very.program.this.like.i
Example 2:

Input:
S = pqr.mno
Output: mno.pqr
Explanation: After reversing the whole
string , the input string becomes
mno.pqr

Logic:
1) its just simple traversing of string
2) add the characters till "." is encountered
3) after encouter push that string in vector
4) Time Complexity O(n)
5) Space Complexity O(n)
